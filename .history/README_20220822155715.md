# Implementatino Notes

(According to the tech task description)

1. In the `bash data` folder you'll find formSchema.json with the required structure
2. To add input validation I modified the json fiel and added this logic to the components (see Input.tsx, RadioGroup.tsx)
3. In this project I used Next.js because it is a good use-case for such application.

4.

# Visible improvements

There are of course a lot of things to improve in this project, such as:

1. Add Redux to make filling out and storing form data easier.
2. Add tests
3. Add additional form libraries to make them easier (For example, Formik)
4. Rewrite Field.tsx using the Builder design pattern instead of Switch.
5. Create a custom React library for all components and simply reuse them in this project.
6. Add scripts for CI/CD to run tests during the build process.
7. Fix current bugs

- I didn't complete this project fully because I think even this is quite enough to understand my skills in React.
